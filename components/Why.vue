        The project is hosted on Cloudflare, which offers a free service for
        sending emails using the MailChannels API when utilizing a worker. When
        hosting a Nuxt project on Cloudflare, it essentially functions as a
        single, powerful worker, allowing me to utilize this feature for sending
        emails effectively.
